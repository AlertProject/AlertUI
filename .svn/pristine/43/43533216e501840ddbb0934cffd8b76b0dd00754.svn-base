-Define templates for different post types

For "find similar items" add <conditions><postTypes>issues</postTypes></conditions> inside the <query ></query>

Item list
    Bottom of the list should display the total number of results. We should also have buttons Next and Previous that change different items
    If keywords are specified in the search query then highlight them
    Templates for different item types
        Source code commits
            Don't have subject, just body text
            Items don't have "from" attribute. Instead use "author" attribute

Timeline
    Modify the functionality to support two types of interactions. One type is zooming in and out. The other type is selecting a subset of timeline and refine the query using an additional constraint
    Clicking on one bar zooms in to -1 -2

Wordcloud
    Make the size of the cloud appropriate for the width of the window part (don't show the scrollbar)
    Clicking a word adds it to the search condition
